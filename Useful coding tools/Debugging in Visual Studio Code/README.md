Highly recommended to check official site of Debugging in Visual Studio Code

For better understanding pull the work and use debugger(VScode LLDB)  to see how each step works.
Any suggestion's will be highly appreciated. -_-

Don't ever forget ever to use `-g` like the example below during compiling:

```diff
bash-3.2$ gcc main.c get_next_line.c get_next_line.h libft.a -g
```
